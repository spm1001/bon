prompt = """Run the following bon CLI command and display the output:

!{bon {{args}}}

If the command was `bon list`, format the output as a readable hierarchy showing outcomes and their child actions. If the command was `bon show`, highlight the three flags (--why, --what, --done). If the command was `bon work` or `bon step`, show the tactical step progression clearly.

If no args are provided, run `bon status` to show the current overview."""
