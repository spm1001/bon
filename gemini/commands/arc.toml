prompt = """Run the following arc CLI command and display the output:

!{arc {{args}}}

If the command was `arc list`, format the output as a readable hierarchy showing outcomes and their child actions. If the command was `arc show`, highlight the three flags (--why, --what, --done). If the command was `arc work` or `arc step`, show the tactical step progression clearly.

If no args are provided, run `arc status` to show the current overview."""
